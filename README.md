NFL Clock is a hobby project I developed to help keep track of when the next NFL game is on. It's designed to be embeddable in a low power microcomputer, but can also be viewed online at [nflclock.com](https://nflclock.com) (though the alarm clock feature only works with the native wrapper due to browser limitations).
